INTRODUCTION
------------
History:
  Field_group was originally written when drupal 7 was released. For drupal 6,
  the module is located in the CCK module (http://drupal.org/project/cck).
  As drupal core has a fields API drupal > 6, the field_group module
  is considered a contribution.

Description:
  field_group is a module that will group a set of fields. In Drupal8,
  with fields, one means all fields that come from fieldable entities.
  You can add fieldgroups in several types with their own format settings.
  field_group uses plugins to add your own formatter and rendering for
  it.
  One of the biggest improvements to previous versions, is that fieldgroups
  have unlimited nesting, better display control.
  Note that field_group will only group fields, it can not be used to hide
  certain fields since this a permission matter.

managed_form_display and managed_display of the entity type.

grouping using the desired formatter for displaying the same.

4. The field grouping done in managed display will be reflected on the
view detail page of the entity, while that done in the
managed_form_display will be reflected in the add/edit form of the entity.

-- Create field groups --
This section explains how to create groups of fields according to the type chosen.
    - Fieldsets : This group of fields makes the internal content in a fieldset.
                  It is possible to add a title and a caption (which appears at
                  the bottom of the fieldset).
    - Details : Similar to Fieldsets. You can configure them to be open (normal
                fieldset) or collapsed.
    - Details Sidebar: Similar to Details. You can configure them to be open
                (normal fieldset) or collapsed and move them in the sidebar on
                the node form.
    - Html element : This fieldgroup renders the inner content in a HTML element.
                     You can configure attributes and label element.
The following two groupings works differently because you must associate them with
an other grouping.
    - Accordions : This group of fields makes the child groups as a jQuery accordion.
                   As a first step you must create an Accordions group. You can set a
                   label and choose an effect. Then you can create an Accordion
                   Item as a child. This group can contain fields.
    - Tabs : This fieldgroup renders child groups in its own tabs wrapper.
             As a first step you must create an Tabs group. You can set
             choose if you want that your tabs are show horizontally or vertically.
             Then, you can create Tab as a child and choose one to be open by default.
             This group can contain fields.
For all groups, you can add id or classes.
You can also choose if you want to mark a group as required if one of his fields is
require (except for Accordions and Tabs : you must passed by their children).

INTRODUCTION
------------

Admin Toolbar Extra Tools provides menu links to administration pages or actions
(eg. Flushing caches) that are not generated by Drupal core. It adds menu items
that are not generated by Drupal core. For example there are no menu items for
each content type by default or menu links to Manage fields on each entity
types. That's the purpose of Admin Toolbar Extra Tools to add them.

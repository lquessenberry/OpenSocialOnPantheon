INTRODUCTION
------------

Admin Toolbar intends to improve the default Drupal Toolbar to transform it into

REQUIREMENTS

No special requirements.


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

 * Admin Toolbar Extra Tools (https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar):
   Provides menu links to administration pages or actions (eg. Flushing caches)
   that are not generated by Drupal core.

 * Admin Toolbar Links Access Filter (https://www.drupal.org/node/2474539):
   Provides a workaround for the common problem that users with
   'Use the administration pages and help' permission see menu links they don't
   have access permission for.

INSTALLATION

   See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

# Default settings should not be located here. This file is only used to
# install initial setting values. If your theme is the one that introduces a
# new theme setting, it should use the Drupal Bootstrap base theme's
# @BootstrapSetting annotation discovery process. This ensures that sub-theme
# settings are inherited from base themes themes properly and to determine when
# a setting should be saved to config as "overridden".

This is the fork of MinkExtension library that supports PHP `>=7.4` and supports Symfony `>=4.4`.

For the documentation, please [refer to the original repository](https://github.com/Behat/MinkExtension).

No updates other than Symfony compatibility will be provided, but this fork _might_ be synchronised with the original repository in the future.
